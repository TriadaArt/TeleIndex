The AI engineer successfully bootstrapped and iteratively developed a comprehensive Telegram Channels Catalog web application. The development trajectory began with clarifying core product requirements, moving from a basic public catalog MVP to a feature-rich Phase 1 implementation. Key steps included establishing a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, a React frontend with Tailwind CSS, and adhering to strict environment variable and URL handling rules. The AI addressed critical technical challenges such as frontend build errors due to HTML entities, a MongoDB text index conflict, and robust HTML scraping for channel data. The process was highly iterative, with constant user feedback driving UI/UX refinements, data model extensions, and feature additions like multi-user admin, content moderation, parsing from external sources (Telemetr, TGStat, Telega.in), and link checking. The AI consistently provided an  account for testing and introduced a Заполнить демо feature to quickly populate the catalog, ensuring continuous verification of UI and backend functionality. The project evolved from a basic listing to a visually sophisticated hybrid design inspired by telega.in and wowblogger.ru, including detailed channel cards, a dedicated detail page, and enhanced admin features, all with Russian localization.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create a modern, fast, and SEO-optimized Telegram Channels Catalog website. The application should automatically gather new channels via parsing external sources (tgstat.ru, telemetr.me, telega.in), allow manual moderation via an admin panel, and present channels in a user-friendly catalog. The design is heavily inspired by telemetr.io and telega.in, adapted for unique features like a trending widget, Russian UI, detailed metrics, and dead link notifications.

**Key features include:**
-   **Public Catalog UI**: A clean, modern, mobile-first, responsive grid layout with card-based display. Each card must show avatar/logo, channel name, category, language, country/city, short/SEO description, subscribers, price, ER%, CPM₽, 30-day growth, last post date, and Открыть (internal detail) / Перейти (external t.me link) buttons. Includes a header with search, Категории chip row, and sort options (Популярные, Новые, По имени, Цена, ER). A Trending widget (4 featured items) should be displayed above the grid. Pagination (24 items per page) is required.
-   **Channel Detail Page**: A dedicated page ( route, currently hash-based) with a large avatar, name, tags (category/language/country), prominent subscribers and price. A metrics block (tiles for ER, CPM, 30-day growth, last post), full description, and a Перейти в Telegram CTA. Basic OG/meta tags for SEO are needed.
-   **Admin Panel / Moderation**: Local multi-user email/password login with JWT authentication. Dashboard includes:
    -   **Summary**: Counters for Drafts/Approved/Dead Links, mini-trends.
    -   **Drafts**: Display parsed channels as drafts, allow inline editing of SEO descriptions (auto-save), and approve/reject actions.
    -   **Approved**: Toggle , edit all channel fields inline.
    -   **Add Channel**: Manual form for all channel fields (including new metrics).
    -   **Import**: Sources for Telemetr/TGStat/Telega.in list URLs (with site-specific scrapers for accurate data extraction: avatar, subscribers, category), and a reliable Импорт из ссылок textarea for pasting t.me links/usernames.
    -   **Link Checker**: Button to trigger batch verification of t.me links, updating  (alive/dead) and reflecting in summary.
-   **Data Model**: Extended to include fields like , , ,  (Engagement Rate),  (₽),  (₽ per 1000 views),  (%),  (ISO date), and .
-   **Seed Data**: The Заполнить демо button should load a specific 10-channel dataset (including images and full metrics), with 3 channels marked as featured.
-   **SEO & Technical**: Clean, semantic code; proper meta-tags, robots.txt, sitemap.xml (dynamic needed later); scalable architecture (MongoDB, UUIDs, ISO timestamps, no ObjectIds); all backend routes prefixed with ; frontend using , backend using . Russian UI and categories.

The current state includes a fully functional catalog and admin panel, with the hybrid design implemented and populated with the specified demo data.
